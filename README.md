# status_grab

This is a Flutter app which is used to download WhatsApp Status images and videos of your friends.

## How did the idea come?

This project started one day when I wanted to download a video from a friend's WhatsApp status. I decided on creating a quick app. I should say that in the thick of development, I got stuck on how to implement video download and subsequently play, at that moment I found a resource which had a similar idea online. 

The idea is not new and the code is not entirely mine.

## Next steps?

This project is not yet on app store. I am working on perfecting it and I hope that I will one day get time to get it right and ready for the market.

I also have to get good colours, nice logo and make this video play look like a video player. Currently its an embarrassment
